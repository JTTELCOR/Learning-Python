# My First Repo: Learning Python
This repo will help me learn how to use GitHub

## Resources for Learning Python
I started learning Python by completing the ["Try It: Intro to Python"](https://www.edx.org/course/intro-python) course on edX. I am keeping a list of other resources I have found helpful in [this file](python_coding_resources.md). I will keep updating this list as I learn more.

## Python Projects
Here are the Python projects I have completed so far:
* **[Hello World](my-first-repo/hello_world)**, a basic Python program that prints text.
I will add additional projects to this repo as I complete them.
